                <p>Always check the tracking link that you received by email. It might be possible that the estimated delivery time has changed, or that you accidentally entered the wrong address. The estimated delivery time didn’t change and your address is correct? Please check your email again to see if you received a message from the shipping company. The package may have been delivered to a pick-up point or a different address, or your delivery window may have been rescheduled. Still no luck? Get in touch with our Customer Care Team (customercare@an-na.com) to ensure a quick delivery of your order.</p>

            <div class="content">
                <p>Yes, when you decide to return your order the return costs will be deducted from the refund. When you decide to keep at least one item of your order, no return costs will be charged.

                  Are you not sure about what size to order, we advise to order more than one size to reduce the risk of paying for return costs.
                  
                  Important: always register your return through our online return form to make sure your return is processed smoothly. Once your return is registered you receive a return label as a last step in our online return portal. This way you don’t have to pay for your return at the postal service as we eventually settle the return costs with the refund.
                  
                  In no case is AN&NA responsible for shipping costs paid by the customer at a postal office by not following our return policy.</p>
